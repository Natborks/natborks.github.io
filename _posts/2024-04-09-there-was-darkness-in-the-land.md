Imagine if instead of the gruesome scenes leading up to Jesus’ death on the cross, He passed away peacefully after saying goodbye to His disciples. Imagine if instead of darkness, a torn veil, and an earthquake (Matthew 27:51), everyone continued their day knowing that he would rise again.

The events depicted in His crucifixion illustrate the operation of God’s divine providence: People were doing what they felt was right for them at the time, but God allowed these events to unfold the way they did because of their deeper spiritual significance. Let’s explore.

## Good Friday isn’t a day of celebration. But Why?

There’s a common sentiment that Good Friday shouldn’t be a day of celebration. It is usually a day for people to mourn Christ’s death on the cross. However, considering the significance of His death according to prophecies in the Old Testament, it might indeed be a cause for celebration. What bears pondering, nonetheless, are the events leading up to the crucifixion (from the triumphant entry to His being nailed to the cross), and why people turned on him so quickly.

## The entry and work of Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ represents truth that brings us closer to the goodness of God. He declared, "I am the way, the truth, and the life…" (John 16:4). It is also why Jesus dedicated his life to teaching these truths. However, many among the Jews failed to grasp the depth of His message. Instead, they sought a king who would reign with glory and power, exalting them and making other nations serve them. But this isn’t what He is. These contrasting viewpoints caused a lot of tension between Himself and the Jews. He rebuked them (Read why [here](https://www.therationalmind.org/morality/2023/04/29/civil-moral-and-spiritual/)). He cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers (Matt 21:15). These actions left the Jewish leaders bitter, leading them to plot Jesus' death.

Similarly, we might misunderstand Jesus, projecting our selfish desires onto him, which can hinder our ability to accept Him. Contrary to our assumptions, when genuine truth from God enters our lives, it can be disruptive and uncomfortable, initially, because of the work it does in realigning our selfish desires with what God wants. When faced with this truth, we have a choice: embrace it and grow, or reject it. Unfortunately, many of the Jews at the time chose the latter, leading to Jesus' crucifixtion. Nevertheless, his sacrifice illustrates how everything aligns for good in God’s divine providence. In this instance, bringing redemption, and saving man from eternal damnation.

## Take Away

It's important to recognize that this account isn't merely historical; It is a cautionary tale on how easy it is to espouse certain ideals outwardly about God but turn against them in our hearts because we aren’t willing to be introspective and change in the face of His reality. The key lessons to take away are as follows: 1. Grasp the essence of who Jesus is and the truths he presents. 2. Understand the implications of accepting him into our lives. 3. Embrace the transformations he initiates within us.

During Jesus' crucifixion, darkness engulfed the land for three hours. This darkness symbolizes the desolation that accompanies the complete rejection of the principles—embodied by Christ—that offer salvation. The Easter celebrations and a solar eclipse that followed not long after serve as profound reminders of this fact.
