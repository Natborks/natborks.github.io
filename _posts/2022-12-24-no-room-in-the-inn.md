Christmas is an annual event commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ and is celebrated by billions of people around the world on December 25 (Wikipedia). The circumstances surrounding Christ’s birth are quite peculiar. On the surface, it looks like the Lord avoiding all high expectations and coming into the world in humility, but there’s more to it. In its depths, it’s a story of love, growth, and the role you have to play in extending the Lord’s reach to all mankind

## The Birth of Christ

The birth of Christ, albeit a historic event, need not be seen as a one-time occurrence because the word of God is everlasting (Isaiah 40:8), and if it is everlasting, then it is applicable to our present lives.

The birth of Christ marks a stage in our spiritual journey where we feel God’s presence in a new way. In life, we face numerous difficulties, some of which can be daunting. However, these difficulties also present opportunities for the Lord to reveal himself to us in new ways. Our understanding of life is elevated as a result of this manifestation, and we go through life wanting to share God's love with others and volunteering to serve others (Matthew 22:34-40). Such an experience is a depiction of Christ’s birth in us.

## No Room In The Inn

Inns, historically, were places for travellers to replenish (rest and refill with food and drink) before they continued their journey. Regarding our spiritual lives, inns represent the ideas, and activities that we rest on and refill with on our spiritual journey. As we sojourn through life, our spiritual states are continuously changing, so we also need spiritual inns to replenish. 

The conditions surrounding the birth of Christ two thousand years ago were unfavourable for his physical birth. The Jews back then were misinterpreting and misapplying God’s word, turning the church of the Lord into a place of commerce, and doing many other things which were unpleasant in the sight of the Lord. In a similar manner, our current state of mind, the beliefs we hold, the knowledge we acquire, and the activities we are involved in could be unfavourable for his spiritual birth in our lives.  It’s not sheer coincidence that there wasn’t room for Christ’s birth in the inn. God always arranges everything in order, and what occurred then was just a snapshot representing the state of the church at the time.

As the Bible says in Ecclesiastes, there’s nothing new under the sun. Since the word of God is always applicable to our lives, we must ask ourselves, “What similar activities are we engaged in that are making our inns full?” Yes, life is difficult, and we might be in a bind at the moment, but does it excuse a misapplication of God’s word to justify our current deeds? If our deeds allow for the entrance of God’s leadership on how we conduct our lives, then we have room in our inn for Christ, and we can be sure of His deliverance, joy, hope, loving-kindness and peace. Otherwise, we have no room for Him in our inn.

## Conclusion

The birth of Christ in our lives is a tremendous opportunity for spiritual growth. During this festive season, many people will be travelling to see their families, or just to enjoy their vacations. Many will spend time in hotels, which are like modern-day inns. Yet, in our working hard to afford such vacations, in our day-to-day hustle, in the challenges we face, are we able to make room to feel God’s presence in newer, more uplifting ways? Are we making room in our inns?

Please share your thoughts and how you’ve experienced the birth of Christ in your life this year. We’d love to hear them.

Merry Christmas!
