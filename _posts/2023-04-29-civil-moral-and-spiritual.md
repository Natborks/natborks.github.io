Some people say there is no need for religion because everyone knows what is moral. This perspective, while seemingly true, is flawed. Also, some people are righteous because they are scared of hell, others are righteous because they seek the reward of heaven. Which of these is the right approach? Let’s explore with the following topic: Civil, Moral, and Spiritual Good.

## Civil Good:

This is the level of laws, statutes, instructions, taboos, etc. Good deeds done on this level are usually done to avoid punishment. For instance, stealing will get one arrested, so one does not steal. This is the lowest form of good. Below this level, man is sinking into depravity. Good deeds on this level alone are inherently dead because they are done only to avoid negative consequences. A person who acts on this level alone is called a civil man.

## Moral Good:

Virtues like hard work, integrity, kindness, etc. are usually not enforceable by any justice system but are beneficial to society. This is the realm of moral good or rational good, since it can also be thought of as what is reasonable.

However, hidden within this good are the motives from which one operates. The motives for these virtuous acts may be entirely self-serving, not necessarily for the goodness itself — which is usually the case because what is called good on this level is highly subjective. A person who acts on this level is called a moral man.

## Spiritual good

This is good done on account of selfless love: love for the Lord and love for the neighbour, or what is the same, love for the greater good. On this level, we do what is right because it is beneficial to the commonwealth of society, thus in line with God’s will. A person acting on this level is a spiritual man.

Outwardly, spiritual good is not different from civil and moral good, but inwardly it is entirely different. Also, moral and civil good are dead works (Hebrews 6:1) if they are not enlivened by spiritual good.

## Morality can be used as a means to serve our own selfish ends

As humans, we are usually self-centred, and we usually act in line with self-benefitting motives. While this may not be entirely bad, it can have negative consequences in the long run. Think of shady politicians running for office. They make all the promises, extol their virtues, and perform acts of service in a show of humility and readiness to serve, but when they’re voted into power — when it really matters — they have nothing to offer. Even when they act, it is for their own benefit.

Morality can be used to serve our own selfish ends. When operating on the level of moral goodness alone, we tend to brag about it; we seek honour and favour for it; we look down on others because of it; we virtue signal, etc (Luke 18:10-14). This is why morality alone is not enough: it can be done from a self-centred viewpoint, seeking only what we can get in return. Spiritual good, however, is done for what is beyond ourselves: the common, useful good. As Jesus said in Matthew 5:19-20, " For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven"

## ”Hypocrites”

There are many places in the Bible where God warns us about these dead works. In Matthew chapter 6, The Bible talks about those who do their acts of righteousness for everyone to see. They are rebuked as hypocrites who seek the honour of men. In Isaiah 64:5, Bible talks about “him who rejoices and does righteousness, Who remembers You (God) in your ways”, as against people who have all sinned and whose righteousness are as filthy rags in verse 6. God draws near to the former and the latter He does not because their righteousness are filled with iniquity. As mentioned earlier, morality can be used to seek our own selfish ends or exalt ourselves above others. This, the Lord doesn’t want.

## The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom

Morality alone is not enough, and that is why we need to seek the Lord's face in all our acts of righteousness. As we begin to seek the Lord’s will in determining what the right thing to do is, he opens our minds to what is truly useful and good in every situation. This wisdom is the basis of spirituality (spiritual good), the rock on which one’s house is built (Matthew 7:24-25). This spirituality has the effect of simultaneously blessing us with the rewards of heaven, while keeping us away from the gates of hell.

## Takeaway

We usually move from one stage to the next in our spiritual development. As children, we usually operate on the first level (civil good). As teenagers and early adults, we usually operate on the second level (moral good), and as adults, the final (spiritual good). But life is not perfect, and we find that even as adults we’re usually acting only on the lower levels. However, what God wants is for us to operate from the highest level: spiritual good. This way, our spiritual good will flow into our moral and civil states and edify them. It’s a step-by-step growth process through which He is constantly guiding and providing for us.
