It begins with the mind. An ordered mind is an ordered life. Yet, it can be a huge challenge to see through the confusion and live orderly life. The reason for this confusion is that we are often torn between our lower pleasures and our higher pleasures.

The good news is that there is also a rational mind. Put simply, the rationality provides a framework in which both worlds can work in concert to bring us purposeful lives. It follows, then, that working on our rationality equals building sustainable lifestyles, or living a life of love and usefulness.

> But now we know that a sequestered life without aspiration enfeebles the spirit. It is exactly the same as with the body. The muscles must be used, or they lose their strength. If we do not go out of our limited experience somehow and use our memory, understanding, and sympathy, they become inactive. It is by fighting the limitations, temptations, and failures of the world that we reach our highest possibilties.
