The reason for this confusion is that we are often torn between the pleasures of the lower mind and those of higher mind. Each one with its unique characteristics, yet both of them needing to work together to bring us fuller, more useful lives. The good news is that there is also a rational mind. Put simply, the rational mind provides a framework in which both worlds can work in concert to bring us purposeful lives. It follows, then, that working on our rationality equals building sustainable lifestyles.</p>
