<p>Modern relationships can, at times, feel more like contracts than actual love. A lot of the debate on the internet is about who brings what to a relationship, what is received for love shown, etc. The paradox here is that while we crave love in its most idealistic form (i.e pure and unconditional love), we choose love primarily based on what we will gain (power, status, money, excitement, personal value, etc.). Such an orientation leaves us overly concerned with conditions that must be present in and around a potential partner, yet none of these conditions matter for the longevity of romantic associations. Loving someone means we care about their well-being just as much as we care about our own, or even more. It may seem counterintuitive, but it is the only way to build sustainable relationships.</p>
