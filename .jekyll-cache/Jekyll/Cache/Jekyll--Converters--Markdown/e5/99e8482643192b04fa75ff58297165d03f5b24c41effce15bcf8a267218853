I"<<p>It begins with the mind. An ordered mind is an ordered life. Yet, it can be a huge challenge to see through the confusion and live orderly life. The reason for this confusion is that we are often torn between the pleasures of the lower mind and those of higher mind. Each one with its unique characteristics, yet both of them needing to work together to bring us fuller, more useful lives.</p>

<p>The good news is that there is also a rational mind. Put simply, the rational mind provides a framework in which both worlds can work in concert to bring us purposeful lives. It follows, then, that working on our rationality equals building sustainable lifestyles, or living a life of love and usefulness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But now we know that a sequestered life without aspiration enfeebles the spirit. It is exactly the same as with the body. The muscles must be used, or they lose their strength. If we do not go out of our limited experience somehow and use our memory, understanding, and sympathy, they become inactive. It is by fighting the limitations, temptations, and failures of the world that we reach our highest possibilties.</p>
